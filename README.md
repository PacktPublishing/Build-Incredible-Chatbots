## About the Video Course
Welcome to the most comprehensive and complete bot developer course. In this course, we will go from zero to pro as we build multiple chatbots using a variety of techniques and platforms. We will explore chatbot platforms that do not require you to write code, and all the way to code intensive chatbots that can be built for specialized scenarios.

We will learn about the brain behind a chatbot, as we go from simple pattern recognition to natural language processing and AI. This course features an ever evolving project based curricula that will see new sections, case studies and examples being added on a regular basis. This is critical because this technology space is growing by leaps & bounds and consequently this course aims to keep up with the pace. All of this comes with personalized help, hand holding and support. And even before reaching the end of the course, you will be able to build and deploy chatbots and offer this brand new way of reaching out to the world, to your customers and business.

Chatbots can help people shop, order food, entertain, provide help, advice, information, support and more, through a simple chat interface. Imagine chatting with a friend on Facebook Messenger. No learning curve needed, no apps to install.
